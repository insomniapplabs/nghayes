				<h2 class="text-center latolight secondary-header">How It Works</h2>
				<p class="text-center latolight secondary-text">Hayes Energy improves the overall efficiency of a hospital’s central plant while minimizing the competition between its heating and cooling systems, ultimately saving them money on their gas and electric bills.</p>

				<!-- SCROLL IN CONTENT -->
				<h3 class="text-center latoblack how-step-header">Step 1: Establish A Facilities Baseline</h3>
				<p class="latolight how-step-text">One can't accurately identify a facility's energy savings simply by comparing last year's energy usage to this year's. Factors such as weather may have had a more dramatic impact one year when being compared to the next. For example, 2008 may have had a hotter summer than 2009. A hotter summer would translate into higher air conditioning loads, which typically results in higher utility bills.</p>
				<p class="latolight how-step-text">Therefore, we collect 12 months of daily gas and electric consumption for a given facility and match that utility consumption data with the average daily temperature for each day in the model period. By matching historical consumption to average daily temperature we can project what a facility historically would have consumed at any given temperature.</p>
				<p class="latolight how-step-text">So, instead of comparing last year's usage to the year's usage, our software factors in the weather data so that we can compare how much energy a respective facility would have used this year to how much energy it did use this year.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center latoblack how-step-header">Step 2: Energy Conservation</h3>
				<p class="latolight how-step-text">Once the baseline is established, our regional field engineer will survey a facilities central plant in order to make energy conservation recommendations that help reduce overall consumption without affecting patient comfort of humidity control.</p>
				<p class="latolight how-step-text">These recommendations vary based on the HVAC make up of each facility. Sample recommendations include adjustments to discharge temperatures, on air handler systems, hot and chilled water temperatures on air conditioning units, identifying bad steam traps, and enhancing boiler efficiency.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center latoblack how-step-header">Step 3: Daily Meter Readings</h3>
				<p class="latolight how-step-text">As opposed to waiting for a monthly utility bill in order to assess a hospital's energy consumption, we provide daily feedback and savings reports, which illustrate the bottom-line impact of our energy conservations recommendations.</p>
				<p class="latolight how-step-text">Once we receive a daily fas and electric meter reading from your staff, we provide trend analysis reports, which depict the amount of energy savings generated from our energy conservation recommendations.</p>

					<p class="text-center latolight secondary-text">"We didn't believe the savings at first. We thought it might have something to do with the cooler summer we had, but our CFO did an analysis and validated the results. Last month we saved almost 15 percent and our year-to-date savings are significant. If you have an aging plant, just keep an open mind. You'll be pleased with the results"</p>
